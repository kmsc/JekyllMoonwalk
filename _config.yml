  The Khoury Master’s Student Council (KMSC) serves as an official liaison between master’s students and the administration at Khoury College. The mission of the Council is to promote master’s student interests to enrich academic and student life within the Khoury master’s department. As a member of KMSC, you’ll be part of an organization that aims to promote the appreciation of diversity and inclusion of all people within the department. Every semester, you’ll engage by attending movie nights, open mics, game nights, academic and career mentoring events, and panel discussions. You’ll have the opportunity to network with other students and share your concerns by attending KMSC’s open meetings. KMC’s goal is to foster diversity, inclusion, and mutual learning within the master’s programs while allowing students to make the most of their time at Khoury.
